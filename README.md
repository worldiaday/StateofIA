# State of Information Architecture

Created by Optimal Workshop and World IA Day, the State of Information Architecture Report is an open resource for understanding the practice and boundaries of information architecture work.

### Background
In 1998, the book Information Architecture for the World Wide Web was published. A year later, the first IA Summit convened in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. In 2002, the Information Architecture Institute was founded. The first European IA Summit took place in 2005 in Brussels, Belgium. Now, the topic of information architecture is nearly absent, save for sitemaps and navigation. 

How relevant is information architecture? Is IA dead? Even more than before, information architecture is necessary and essential for helping the world’s people make sense of the connected world around them. 

#### Our vision and purpose
The purpose of this research study is to look deeply at who is practicing information architecture today, what kind of work are they doing and how they’re doing it. We’ll look at how people understand information architecture, what they anticipate for the future of this work. At the same time, this research will document the state of the practice and field of information architecture in 2021 and set a baseline for future research, development, and understanding of information architecture.

We hope that this report will share this understanding that while the title of “information architect” wanes throughout the times, our work and study-whether in design, research, industry-have some association with the principles of information architecture. 

### 2021 Survey
