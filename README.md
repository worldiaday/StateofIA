# State of Information Architecture

Created by Optimal Workshop and World IA Day, the State of Information Architecture Report is an open resource for understanding the practice and boundaries of information architecture work.

> We're working on the 2021 State of IA survey. 

The latest State of IA report can be found in (/2020). 

### How can I contribute? 
We're looking for researchers, editors, proofreaders, translators. Check out Projects > 2021 and assign something to yourself!

### What will you do with the results?
All the information we collect will be anonymized and made publicly available. We encourage everyone to explore the data, react to it, and help improve the research over time. We'll produce and share an official report once the data has been gathered and analyze.
